# spectroscpy
## A club project of HORIZON IITM 
Python code to calculate the temperature of a star. The python file uses fits file of a star's spectran and fit it with blackbody raidaition curve. Fitting is done by least squares mean methon used from scipy module. 
temp.py has the python code and is specific to the stars from ESO library, fits file for different types of stars can be found on https://www.eso.org/sci/facilities/paranal/decommissioned/isaac/tools/lib.html.
